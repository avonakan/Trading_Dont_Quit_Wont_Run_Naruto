# Deduplicated Trading Analysis - Final Report

## The Deduplication Discovery

### What Was Wrong with Original Data

**Original CSV had 970 rows representing only 448 unique trades**

The problem: Multiple rows existed for the same trade (same symbol, same entry conditions, same exit conditions, same verdicts). These were likely:
- Multiple lots/quantities of the same position
- Same trade split across multiple entries in tracking system
- Database duplication

### Example of Duplication

**KAYNES trade appeared 6 times:**
- All 6 rows: 21.76% above 50 DMA at entry
- All 6 rows: -1.03% vs 50 DMA at exit
- All 6 rows: Bad call + Wrong early sell
- **These represent 1 trade, not 6 trades**

**GOLDBEES trade appeared 10 times:**
- All 10 rows: Same entry conditions
- All 10 rows: Same exit conditions
- **This is 1 trade, not 10 trades**

### The Impact

| Data Version | Rows/Trades | Duplicates Removed |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Original CSV | 970 rows | - |
| Deduplicated | 448 unique trades | 522 duplicates (53.8%!) |

**More than HALF the rows were duplicates!**

**Exit (Fix 59% wrong early):**
1. NEVER sell DMA Diff 5-10% uptrends
2. Don't panic sell death cross recoveries
3. Only exit when DMA Diff narrows to 0-5%

### Potential After Fixes
- Entry: 58% â†’ 75%+ (remove death cross entries)
