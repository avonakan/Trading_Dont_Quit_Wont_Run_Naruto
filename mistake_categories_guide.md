**ENTRY MISTAKES:**

- **"Below 200 DMA"** - 247 occurrences
  - Price was below the 200-day moving average when you bought
  - This indicates buying into a downtrend or weak position
  - 45% failure rate for these trades

- **"Death Cross (50<200)"** - 263 occurrences
  - The 50 DMA was below 200 DMA (bearish configuration)
  - Shows weak momentum and trend
  - 43% failure rate for these trades

- **"Weak DMA Diff (<3%)"** - 41 occurrences
  - The spread between 50 and 200 DMA was too narrow
  - Indicates consolidation or lack of strong trend

- **"Overbought (>15% above DMA)"** - 360 occurrences
  - Price was extended more than 15% above either moving average
  - You bought into parabolic moves
  - 34% failure rate - often leads to pullbacks

- **"GOOD ENTRY"**
  - Price above 200 DMA
  - 50 DMA significantly above 200 DMA (>5% spread)
  - Price not overextended (<12% above 50 DMA)
  - This is your ideal entry setup

### 3. Exit Mistake
Specific issues with your sell timing. Only populated for "Wrong early sell" trades:

**EXIT MISTAKES:**

- **"Sold above both DMAs"** - 392 occurrences
  - Price was still above both 50 and 200 DMA when you sold
  - Classic premature exit during strong trend
  - Both support levels still intact

- **"Sold during improving trend"** - 436 occurrences
  - The DMA spread was widening (50 DMA pulling away from 200 DMA)
  - Trend was actually strengthening when you exited
  - You sold during acceleration, not deterioration

- **"Panic sold crossing below 50 DMA"** - 59 occurrences
  - You bought above 50 DMA but sold when price touched/crossed below it
  - The 50 DMA is SUPPORT in uptrends, not a sell signal
  - These trades averaged 17% more gains after you sold

- **"Still strong trend (>5% above DMAs)"** - 333 occurrences
  - Price was still significantly above moving averages
  - Momentum remained strong
  - No technical reason to exit

- **Missed Gain Categories:**
  - **"HUGE MISS (>30% left on table)"** - The most painful exits
  - **"Large miss (20-30% left on table)"** - Significant opportunity cost
  - **"Moderate miss (10-20% left on table)"** - Still material losses

- **"GOOD EXIT"**
  - You sold at the right time
  - Stock either declined or stalled after your exit
  - These are your benchmark exits

## How to Use This File

### 1. Filter by Primary Issue
Sort or filter the CSV by "Primary Issue" column to focus on specific problems:

```
EARLY EXIT (wasted good entry) â†’ Focus on these first
```
These 421 trades show you're a better trader than you think. Your entries are solid, you just need to hold longer.

### 2. Study Your "WELL EXECUTED" Trades
Filter for "WELL EXECUTED" (233 trades) and examine:
- What were the DMA conditions at entry?
- What were the DMA conditions at exit?
- How did these differ from your early exits?

### 3. Identify Pattern Trades
Sort by Symbol to see which stocks you repeatedly make the same mistakes on:
- E2E: 29 trades, all bad entries + early exits (STOP TRADING THIS)
- GOLDBEES: 110 trades, mostly good entries but 100% early exits (HOLD LONGER)

### 4. Review Specific Mistake Combinations
Filter for combinations like:
- "Death Cross (50<200)" + "Sold during improving trend"
  - This shows you bought the turnaround but didn't hold through recovery

- "GOOD ENTRY" + "Sold above both DMAs"
  - Perfect entry, panicked exit - pure psychology issue

### 5. Calculate Your Opportunity Cost
Filter "Exit Mistake" column for "HUGE MISS" or "Large miss":
- These show your most expensive mistakes
- Add up the "Price Change Since Sell" for these
- This is real money you left on the table
